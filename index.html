                <p>
                    We are a community of practice dedicated to advancing social equity in disaster risk assessment. 
                    Starting in 2022, our group is a growing community consisting of academics, engineers, social scientists, 
                    practitioners, and policymakers around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to develop approaches to disaster risk assessment that do not prioritize dollars lost, 
                    but rather, prioritize the needs of vulnerable and marginalized communities.

                <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Between 2023 and 2024, we came together in a series of interactive virtual sessions to examine 
                    real-world case studies and develop methodologies to integrate equity considerations into disaster 
                    risk assessment frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and shared learning, we created a guidance note 
                    (coming soon!) with strategies for more inclusive and equity-focused risk assessment practices.
